### Road Accidents and Weather Analysis: Predictive Modeling with R  

Welcome to the **Road Accidents and Weather Analysis** repository! This project explores the relationship between road accidents and weather conditions in Victoria, Australia, using advanced data analysis and modeling techniques in R.  

---  

## Project Overview  
This project integrates road accident and weather datasets to build predictive models and provide actionable insights for emergency services. The repository demonstrates key data science workflows, including:  
- Data collection from APIs and CSV files.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and distributions.  
- Feature engineering, such as calculating the Excess Heat Factor (EHF) to measure heatwaves.  
- Predictive modeling using statistical techniques like linear regression and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).  
- Visualizing results for better decision-making.

## Features  
- **Data Integration:** Combining road accident data with weather data from NOAA and other sources.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of predictors like EHF to capture weather effects.  
- **Statistical Modeling:** Building and comparing models to predict accidents and understand contributing factors.  
- **Visualization:** Generating interactive and static plots to illustrate insights.
